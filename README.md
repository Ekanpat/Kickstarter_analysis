# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The customer's play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time.Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that we already combed through, weâ€™ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
The project focus on execel mastery with a large dataset. The purpose is to visualize campaign outcomes based on the respective launch dates and funding goals. After that, in the conclusion of our analysis, an indepth analysis will be provided based on the worksheet challenge.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The chart below shows the outcome of the campaign based on the initial goal.

- Two conclusions are considered on the Outcomes based on Launch Date as follows:

1. Campaign in May through June is clearly more impactfull and therefore successsful rate is more than 100% compared to campaign conducted throughout end of year in December.
2. Theather is the most profitable campaign category compared to other. it has the most successfull rate if conducted ina specific period mentionned above.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The chart below shows the outcome of the campaign based on the initial goal.

- Conclusions of the Outcomes based on Goals
1. The failure rate is quite important. Pledged vs goals are disparate. We notice that where the amount starts increasing above $1000, a rverse consequence affect the pledged amount. We also notice a 100% failure rate for amount above $50000.
2. By filtering only *plays*, the above situation still reflecting that the goal amount must be maintained below the $5000 treshold to be successful.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Limitations of dataset

1. It misses broad analysis of the insights based on other countries to compare with the targeed sample
2. Lack of data on other categories than theater
3. Lack of data on subcategory under the theater category.

## Recommendation

1. Historical Trends for similar campaign. The graph should displayed perfomance of similar trend to allow the customer to plan goals more efficientlty.
2. Failure rate in other countries and based on different category and subcategory 
Descriptive analytics table to determine the mean and central tendency. At least having an average target could be of importance.
3. Box and Whisker table. This graph should highlighted the minimum goal to look after for a specfic category of theater to be considered successful.
