## Conclusions

- In the timing outcomes, conducting campaigns in the beggining of the second quarter of the year is proven to be more successfull. December is not recommended to conduct any camapaing. 

- The data flows and lack thereof is obvious. There are outliers which which would need to be handled differently. 

- The exceprt of the descrpitive analysis highlith the correlation of the stndard deviations and the IQR which are three times in the failed kickstarters. With lack of data, we presume that their related golas were too high.
