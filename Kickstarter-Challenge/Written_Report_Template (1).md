# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The customer campaign has come to an end recently. The Customer is looking forward for insights on how different campaigns fared in relation to the respective launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose is to visualize campaign outcomes based on the respective launch dates and funding goals. After that, in the conclusion of our analysis, an indepth analysis will be provided based on the worksheet challenge.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- Two conclusions are are considered on the Outcomes based on Launch Date as follows:

1. Campaign in May through June is clearly more impactfull and herefore successsful rate is more than 100 compared to campaign conducted throughout end of year in December.
2. Theather is the most profitable campaign category compared to other. it has the most successfull rate if conducted ina specific period mentionned above.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. The failure rate is quite important. Pledged vs goals are disparate where if the amount start increasig above $1000, it decease the pledged amount. We also see a 100% failure rate for amount above $50000
2. By filtering only *plays*, the above situation still reflect that the gola amount must be maintained below the $5000 treshold to be successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. It misses broad analaysis of the insights based on other countries to compare with the targeed sample
2. Inclusion of more graphs would have helped such as the failure rate and a descrptive analytics


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Box and Whisker table. This graphs would have highlighted the minimum goal to look after for a specfic category of theater to be considered successful
2. Historical Trends for similar campaign. The graph showing perfomance of similar campaign would have allowed the customer to plan its goals more efficientlty.
